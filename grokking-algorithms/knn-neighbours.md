## Principle
* can do two basic things with KNN
    * classification - categorisation into a group
    * regression - predicting a response (like a number)
* the most important is to pick rights features:
    * features that directly correlate (example: movies - features related to movies)
    * features that don't have bias (movies - if you ask users to only rate comedy movies, that desn't tell you whether they like action movies)

* classifying objects by similarity
    * Pythagora's theorem
    * cosine similarity
