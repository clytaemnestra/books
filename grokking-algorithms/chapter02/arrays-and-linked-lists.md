## Linked lists & Arrays 
### Access
* linked list can only do sequential access 
  * if you want to read the 10th element, you need to read the first 9
  * elements are strewn all over, and one element stores the address of the next one
  * allow fast inserts & deletes 
* arrays can do random access
  * you directly jump to the 10th element
  * arrays thus allow fast reads 
  * all elements are stored right next to each other
