## Linked lists & Arrays 
### Access
    * linked list can only do sequential access 
        * if you want to read the 10th element, you need to read the first 9
        * elements are strewn all over, and one element stores the address of the next one
        * allow fast inserts & deletes 
    * arrays can do random access
        * you directly jump to the 10th element
        * arrays thus allow fast reads 
        * all elements are stored right next to each other
