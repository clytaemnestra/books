## Principle
* OCR = optical character recoginition
* you take a photo of a page of text and computer automatically reads text for you
* you can use KNN for it - example how to figure out which number it is:
    * go through a lot of images of numbers and extract features of numbers
    * when you get a new image, extract the features of that image and see what its nearest neighbours are
