### Principle
* technique to solve a hard problem by breaking it up into subproblems and solving those subproblems first
* every dynamic programming solution involves a grid
* the values in the cells are usually what you're trying to optimize 
* each cell is a subproblem, so think about how you can divide your problem into subproblems

#### Example
