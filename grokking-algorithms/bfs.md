## Principle
* used to answer the following 2 questions:
    * is there a path from node A to node B? 
    * what is the shortest path from node A to node B?
* running time: O(V+E) - number of vertices + number of edges 
* once you check an edge, make sure not to check it again - otherwise you might end up in an infinite loop
